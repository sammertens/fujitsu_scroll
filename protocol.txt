The Fujitsu Scroll Device Protocol

The purpose of this document is to describe the protocol used to communicate
with the two scroll devices on the Fujitsu Lifebook T901 laptop.  These
consist of the Scroll Wheel and the Scroll Sensor; except where noted they
behave identically.

Firstly, each device upon initialization behaves as if it were an ordinary
PS/2 mouse and responds appropriately to all standard commands.  The only
difference is that no motion packets are ever generated.

In order to turn on data packets, an initialization mode byte must be sent
as a sliced command, followed by sending a SETRATE (0xF3) command with a
parameter of 0x14 (20d).  In the mode byte, only two bits were observed to
be significant.
bit 7 (0x80): Enable sending of data packets
bit 5 (0x20): Suppress all capacitance, position data

If bit 7 is not set, there will be no data packets.  If bit 5 is set, data
packets will only be generated when the 'pressed' region of the sensor is
being touched, and no capacitance or position data will be present in the
packets (all 0).

If a PS/2 RESET command is sent to the scroll device, it will revert to
initial behavior and cease generating data packets until the mode is again
set.

An as-of-yet undeciphered set of data can be extracted from both devices by
sending each a sliced command followed by GETINFO (0xe9).  The values of the
3 bytes which are subsequently returned depends upon which device is being
communicated to, and the lower 4 bits of the sent sliced command.  The upper
4 bits do not appear to have any effect.  The returned data appears to always
be the same for the device that returns it.  The data returned from 0x00 is
used for device identification in the driver code.

The scroll wheel (serio2) returns the following:
Command - Response
 0x00 - 0x04 0x43 0x07
 0x01 - 0x03 0x00 0x00
 0x02 - 0x00 0x00 0x05
 0x03 - 0x75 0x82 0x00
 0x04 - 0x3b 0x0f 0x52
 0x05 - 0x11 0x36 0xeb
 0x06 - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x07 - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x08 - 0x48 0x0b 0x00
 0x09 - 0x00 0x09 0x00
 0x0a - 0x09 0x9b 0x52
 0x0b - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x0c - 0x02 0x00 0x00
 0x0d - 0x00 0x3e 0x02
 0x0e - 0x85 0xf4 0x00
 0x0f - 0x0b 0xf4 0xe3

The scroll sensor (serio3) returns the following:
Command - Response
 0x00 - 0x00 0x43 0x07
 0x01 - 0x02 0x00 0x00
 0x02 - 0x00 0x00 0x04
 0x03 - 0x74 0x92 0x00
 0x04 - 0x25 0x06 0x4f
 0x05 - 0x23 0xbf 0xb9
 0x06 - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x07 - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x08 - 0x7c 0x02 0x00
 0x09 - 0x00 0x09 0x04
 0x0a - 0x07 0xdd 0x5b
 0x0b - 0x00 0x00 0x00
 0x0c - 0x02 0x00 0x00
 0x0d - 0xe0 0xff 0x00
 0x0e - 0x57 0x86 0xfd
 0x0f - 0x02 0xed 0x00

Firmware versions?  Serial numbers?  Swiss bank accounts?

Data packets
The data returned always appears to be in 6 byte packets.  Here is
the summary I originally wrote for the header file, which explains it all:
Scroll Wheel packets
 Bytes 0,1,2:  1 0 c c c c c c  0 0 0 0 a a a a  a a a a a a a a
 Bytes 3,4,5:  1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 p 0 0 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 
   c - 6 bits, capacitance, how much capacitance is detected.
               Seems to be highest around a ring inside the wheel
               circle, decreasing the farther the finger is from
               that ring
   a - 12 bits, angle, the angle of the wheel where touch is sensed
                the upper 4 bits are 'f' when the touch is at the
                top of the wheel (12 o'clock), and loops back to 0.
                Increased in a clockwise direction.
   p - 1 bit,  pressed, is the wheel being touched in the center.

   Multitouch is not supported.  If one or more fingers are added to
   a first one that's touching, the reported angle will stay the same
   but the capacitance and center press may change.
 

Scroll Sensor packets
  Same as scroll wheel, except the 'a' angle is now position, with
  lower values to the right and higher values to the left, and 'p'
  now indicates whether a spot on the bezel about 0.5cm left of the
  sensor is being touched.  There is no indication on the bezel where
  this spot is.  Unlike the wheel, it is very possible for 'p' to be 1
  and both 'c' and 'a' to be 0. (Although they may not be if both this
  spot and the sensor are being touched simultaneously.)


This is the current sum of what I know about communication with these
devices.  It's certainly enough to write drivers.  There's a lot more they
which they don't respond to (for instance, the Logitech protocol extensions
appear to fall flat).
